   - SLA: Variable (based on complexity)

8. **TESTING** - Quality assurance testing
   - Fields: Test Results, Defects Found, Test Coverage
   - Attachments: Test reports, bug reports, test data
   - SLA: 24 hours

9. **UAT** - User acceptance testing
   - Fields: UAT Results, User Feedback, Acceptance Criteria
   - Attachments: UAT reports, user feedback, sign-offs
   - SLA: 48 hours

#### **DEPLOYMENT & CLOSURE**
10. **DEPLOYMENT** - Production deployment
    - Fields: Deployment Plan, Rollback Plan, Go-Live Date
    - Attachments: Deployment scripts, monitoring reports
    - SLA: 4 hours

11. **VERIFICATION** - Post-deployment verification
    - Fields: Verification Results, Performance Metrics, Issues Found
    - Attachments: Verification reports, monitoring data
    - SLA: 8 hours

12. **CLOSED** - Request completed
    - Fields: Closure Reason, Lessons Learned, Customer Satisfaction
    - Attachments: Final reports, documentation
    - SLA: 24 hours

#### **EXCEPTION HANDLING**

    - SLA: 24 hours

15. **CANCELLED** - Request cancelled
    - Fields: Cancellation Reason, Impact Assessment, Resource Release
    - Attachments: Cancellation documentation
    - SLA: 4 hours

## Enhanced Data Model

### Ticket Fields (Enhanced):
- **Basic**: title, description, requester info
- **Categorization**: category, subcategory, service, priority, impact, urgency
- **Business**: businessJustification, businessValue, riskAssessment
- **Technical**: technicalAnalysis, dependencies, effortEstimate, architecture
- **Progress**: currentPhase, progressPercentage, blockers
- **SLA**: totalSlaHours, phaseSlaHours, slaBreachRisk
- **Quality**: qualityGates, acceptanceCriteria, testResults
- **Closure**: closureReason, lessonsLearned, customerSatisfaction

### Phase-Specific Fields:
Each phase has specific required fields and optional fields:
- **Required Fields**: Must be completed to transition
- **Optional Fields**: Can be filled for better documentation
- **Attachments**: Phase-specific document types

### File Attachments:
- **Types**: Documents, Images, Code, Reports, Sign-offs
- **Categories**: Requirements, Design, Testing, Deployment, Closure
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to attachments
- **Versioning**: Track file versions and changes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Add attachment table
   - Enhance ticket fields
   - Add phase-specific data tables

2. **Backend API Updates**
   - File upload endpoints
   - Enhanced workflow transitions
   - Phase-specific validation

3. **Frontend Updates**
   - File upload components
   - Enhanced forms per phase
   - Better workflow visualization

4. **SLA Management**
   - Per-phase SLA tracking
   - Breach notifications
   - Performance metrics
